Grocery List;An app for making a grocery list from a list of standard items;https://github.com/Ruben-du-Pon/Python_Cursus/tree/main/web_grocery_list;groceries.png
Overflow Presentation Timer;The overflow Presentation Timer is a timer with subtimers. When a subtimer reaches 0 it will show a red background and start counting up. This way you will know when you took longer than planned for one of your sections, and how much time you will need to make up in the rest of your presentation. If you struggle with a sense of time, this can be very useful! This timer is designed for anyone who needs to keep track of the time they have for their sections. While it is mainly designed for a presentation or educational context, it can be used in many different ways! Subtimers can even be run simultaneously, for use in for instance a kitchen, where you have a main dish and different side dishes, or a certain amount of time to make all the dishes for one table.;https://github.com/Ruben-du-Pon/Timer;timer.png
